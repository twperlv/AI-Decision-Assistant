# AI decision assistant

## Description
This project consists of an AI decision assistant that suggests, in the context
of a specific scenario, which action to do using proportionnal logic, *i.e.* whether
if you have to work from home, take public transport or drive.

## How to run
To run the program, make sure *logic.py* and *work.py* are in the same folder, and run the latter.
You can then create new scenarios with different events using the ```And()``` operator.
